We're looking for dedicated, eager workers to assist us as we move forward toward a brighter future. Could that be you?\n\nCollecting Power Eggs can indeed be a risky business, but when standing shoulder to shoulder in the thick of the action alongside coworkers united under the same vision you may see yourself in a different lightâ€”an innovator, a change-bringer, one who rises to all challenges.\n\nNaturally, you will be well rewarded for your efforts. We offer an attractive and competitive remuneration package to all our employees.", image: "nil", imageCaption: "nil", icon: "nil", sponsored: "False", sponsoredDescription: "nil")

Defeating them will earn you Power Eggs. Attack Behavior: They use their sense of smell to locate and close in on targets who have entered their territory. Once they close in on a target, they perform close-range attacks using frying pans or other cookware. Elimination: Can be neutralized relatively easily with a direct hit of ink. Supporting Information: They inhabit a restricted ocean zone, and any unauthorized contact with them is expressly forbidden by law. The Smallfry might be weak, but they're very fast. They often ambush their targets from below. The larger Cohock moves slowly but packs a real punch with direct, strong attacks. On their own, they don't pose a significant threat, but ignore them and you may quickly find yourself surrounded.", image: "SmallfryChumCohock", imageCaption: "Small Fry, Chum, Cohock", icon: "SnatcherIcon", sponsored: "False", sponsoredDescription: "nil")
